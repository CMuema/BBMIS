About PEEL APPEAL (A Banana Bonanza!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peel Appeal is a vibrant and energetic banana-selling company dedicated to providing the freshest and most delicious bananas to their customers. 

As their business continues to grow, they recognize the need to have a professional web presence that will not only showcase their delightful products but also streamline their operations and enhance their customer experience.

Consequently, they are looking for a straightforward yet effective web application that should be built using:

	HTML, 
	CSS, 
	JavaScript, 
	and Vanilla PHP, 

ensuring it remains lightweight, easy to maintain, and accessible.

Here are the key features they would like the web application to have:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Product Listing: A section to display the different types of bananas they sell.
> Delivery Destinations: A page that lists the various delivery destinations they serve
	- This should include an option to add extra delivery destinations.
> Company Description: A dedicated page describing Peel Appeal, their mission, values, and what sets them apart from other banana sellers.
> Contact Details: An easy-to-find section that provides their contact details.
> Clientele Distribution: A page that will show the number of our dedicated clients per delivery destination.
> Logo: Additionally, they would also like you to design a logo for their company.
> Theme: They have requested that the color theme on the website should match or be close to the actual banana color.
> Feel free to be more creative with other parts of the website
> For now the website must not have the sign-up and sign-in implementation (this will be in version 2)
	- Note that for your class project you MUST implememnt these features
